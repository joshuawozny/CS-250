# CS-250: Scrum Team - Scrum Master
According to the Scrum Guide the Scrum Master is responsible for making sure Scrum is understood and
properly used.  The Scrum Master is a servant-leader for the Scrum Team, facilitating and mentoring to create a cohesive, high functioning team.
The Scrum Master is also responsible for removing impediments to the development process to make all interactions maximize the value
created by the Scrum Team (Overeem, 2016).
