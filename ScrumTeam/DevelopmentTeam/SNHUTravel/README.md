# SNHU Travel Project
SNHU Travel would like to extend their offerings to an online platform that allows travelers to book travel packages. We have been tasked with 
collecting business requirements, user stories and using the Scrum framework to develop a finished application. The sample application displays the Top 5 Destinations.

## Folder Contents
* Initial version of application displaying Destinations as a basic list view
