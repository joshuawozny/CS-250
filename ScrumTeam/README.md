# CS-250: The Scrum Team
The Scrum Team consists of the following roles:
* Product Owner
* Scrum Master
* Development Team

In our project our team consists of Christy, Ron, Brian, and Nicky in the roles of Product Owner, Scrum Master, 
Development Team (tester), and Development Team (developer), respectively. To be clear in the Scrum framework the Development Team members are all 
refered to as developer and are responsible as a group for the success of a project, not as individuals, although each may have individual expertise.

## Team Charter
The team charter describes the Vision and Mission Statement asscoiated with the project and the composition of the team. 
It includes, at a minimum the following elements:
* Success Criteria
* Risks
* Rules of Behavior
* Communication Guidelines

## Tools
The Scrum framework doesn't require any partiicular toolset to function - indeed, Agile methods value people over tools. Scrum is designed to maintain a near-constate flow of communication with each of it's ceremonies centerd on different communication goals. Most Scrum teams use some type of information radiator tool - from the simplest Kanban board to the sophistacated online management systems. For non-trivial projects there are a number of software project managemet tools for Agile devlopment including:
* Jira
* Azure Boards
* RTC
