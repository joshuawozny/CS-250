# CS-250: The Product Backlog
The product backlog is perhaps one of the most important artifacts. It contains all of the use cases identified for a given development project.
Use cases are broken down into individual user stories that describe features from a client's perspective - rather than a technical perpective. 
In the Scrum framework, the Product Owner has ultimate authority and responsibility for the Product Backlog. They are responsible for prioritizing user stories, with the highest priority given to those items that maximize business value. They are also responsible for refining user stories so that they are sufficiently granular to be completed within a single sprint.

Please note that other members of the Scrum Team are often involved in assisting the Product Owner in defining and refining the Product Backlog

* The Scrum Master may assist with defining business value, and assigning story points, etc. to ensure that each user story is sprint-ready.
* Many development teams have embraced Story Time, an unofficial Scrum ceremony that is set aside in the middle of a sprint to review the Product Backlog and help the Product Owner make refinements.

However, it is important to keep in mind that the Product Owner is accountable for any changes made to the Product Backlog.
