You work for ChadaTech, a company that specializes in custom software design and development for both domestic and international clients. For many years, the company has been developing their software using a waterfall development model. Recently, ChadaTech has considered shifting all of its development teams to an agile methodology that uses the Scrum framework. They think the agile approach will enhance their products and build a more cohesive corporate culture. However, before the entire organization makes this shift, ChadaTech has decided to pilot this process with one small team: yours.

Your team has been assigned to develop an application for SNHU Travel, a travel agency seeking to expand their client base with new tools for their customers. Your team will take a Scrum-agile approach to developing the application. Additionally, ChadaTech has asked you to lead a final Sprint Review and Retrospective of the development with your team. This will help your team think through the work that they completed and how the new Scrum-agile approach facilitated the development. Finally, you have been asked to present the lessons youâ€™ve learned to the broader company to help them decide whether or not to shift all development teams to a Scrum-agile approach.

## DEVELOPMENT TECHNIQUES
The most important aspect of software development is identifying requirements. Depending on the methodology, waterfall or agile, this may be done during the intitial phases or continuously throughout the process. Once identified, modeling can assist in orgaizing how the software will work. In particular, I like to create object models, and process flow diagrams. For particular use cases, activity and sequence diagrams may be useful to clarify the sofwatre features. Breaking use cases down into User Stories that present use cases from the user perspective, is an essential element to software development that will delivght the user. The process of refining User Stories gives all team members an understanding of the user needs which will enhance the value of their work.

Each member of the Scrum team serves an essential role in the overall goal of delivering a product of the highest quality. Each team will create a Scrum process that works best for them that emphasizes maximizing product value by optiizing the way that the Development Team works. 

* Product Owner: Responsible for maximizing the product's business value. It's a one-person role that communicates the customer perspective of the product to a Scrum Team. The Product Owner is empowered to make decisions related to the product. The Product Owner is also responsible for the Product backlog, ensuring that it is sprint-ready and prioritize to maximize value with the ultimate goal of customer delight (Overeem, 2016).
* Development Team: A self-organizing professionals who are empowered and accountable as a group to deliver a potentially releasable Increment of "Done" product during each Sprint. The resulting synergy of the Development Team optimizes their overall efficiency and effectiveness (Overeem, 2016).
* Scrum Master: Responsible for making sure Scrum is understood and properly used. The Scrum Master is a servant-leader for the Scrum Team, facilitating and mentoring to create a cohesive, high functioning team. The Scrum Master is also responsible for removing impediments to the development process to make all interactions maximize the value created by the Scrum Team (Overeem, 2016).
